# Pitch Perfect

## Description

This is an iOS application which records your voice and uses audio filters to
manipulate it! Such filters include the "chipmunk" effect, Darth Vader, and
more.

## How to use it

The project was made with XCode 7.3 (sorry Windows users). To run the
application, clone the repository to your desired folder and open the
`PitchPerfect.xcodeproj` file. Once you're there, choose the iOS platform
you'd like to run (located in the top bar near the Run or "play" button).

Then click the Run/Play button to start the application.

## Notes

In this application, I tried to ensure the best user experience across as
many iOS platforms as possible. This includes using as many Constraints
with AutoLayout as possible for the best layouts and sizing across various
platforms.

This is my first iOS application that I have made. It cannot be found on the
App Store. I do not yet have a paid Apple Developer account.
